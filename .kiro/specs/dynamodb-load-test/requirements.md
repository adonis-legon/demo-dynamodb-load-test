# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive DynamoDB load testing application with supporting infrastructure. The system consists of a Java Spring Boot console application that performs configurable load tests against DynamoDB tables, along with CloudFormation infrastructure for deployment, monitoring, and configuration management. The application supports both local development with LocalStack and AWS cloud deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a containerized Java Spring Boot application that can perform load tests against DynamoDB tables, so that I can evaluate database performance under various load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a Java Spring Boot console application using JDK 21 and Maven
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable Spring Boot framework
3. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL create a Docker container using a provided Dockerfile
4. WHEN the container is started THEN the system SHALL accept environment variables from a local environment file
5. WHEN the application detects local environment THEN the system SHALL connect to LocalStack endpoints for AWS services
6. WHEN the application detects AWS environment THEN the system SHALL connect to standard AWS service endpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear architectural separation in the application, so that the code is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN the system SHALL implement a Model layer for business entities
2. WHEN the application is structured THEN the system SHALL implement a Service layer for business logic
3. WHEN the application is structured THEN the system SHALL implement a Repository layer for data access
4. WHEN the application is structured THEN the system SHALL implement an Application layer for application entry points
5. WHEN data access is performed THEN the system SHALL use AWS SDK for Java

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use virtual threads for non-blocking concurrency, so that I can achieve high performance with controlled resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use Java Virtual Threads
2. WHEN concurrency is managed THEN the system SHALL implement a semaphore-based concurrency limit
3. WHEN the concurrency limit is reached THEN the system SHALL block additional operations until capacity is available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want application configuration loaded from AWS SSM Parameter Store, so that configuration can be managed centrally and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from SSM Parameter Store
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL retrieve the DynamoDB table name parameter
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL retrieve the load test concurrency limit parameter
4. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL retrieve the total number of items to write parameter
5. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL retrieve the percentage of items for max concurrency parameter
6. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL retrieve the inject-duplicates boolean parameter

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform load tests with varying concurrency rates, so that I can identify the optimal performance characteristics of the DynamoDB table.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a load test starts THEN the system SHALL begin writing items at different concurrency rates
2. WHEN concurrency increases THEN the system SHALL continue until reaching the configured concurrency limit
3. WHEN items are created THEN the system SHALL generate unique primary keys by default
4. WHEN inject-duplicates is enabled THEN the system SHALL randomly generate duplicate primary keys to simulate conflicts
5. WHEN the load test completes THEN the system SHALL have written the configured total number of items

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive metrics and reporting, so that I can analyze the performance characteristics of the load test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the load test completes THEN the system SHALL output a report to stdout
2. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL include response time metrics
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL include error rate statistics
4. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL include DynamoDB capacity limit errors
5. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL include duplicate key error counts
6. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL include other common error types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CloudFormation infrastructure that supports the application, so that I can deploy and monitor the system in AWS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create SSM parameters for all application configuration
2. WHEN infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a CloudWatch dashboard
3. WHEN the dashboard is created THEN the system SHALL display response time metrics
4. WHEN the dashboard is created THEN the system SHALL display error rate metrics including DynamoDB capacity limits and duplicate key errors
5. WHEN the dashboard is created THEN the system SHALL display write capacity unit usage metrics

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployment automation scripts, so that I can easily deploy and manage the infrastructure across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide a script to deploy/update the CloudFormation stack
2. WHEN the deployment script runs THEN the system SHALL read parameters from environment-specific files (.env.local, .env.prod)
3. WHEN parameters are loaded THEN the system SHALL use the environment suffix to determine the target environment
4. WHEN the stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL apply the configuration parameters to the CloudFormation template

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want container management scripts, so that I can easily start and stop the application with proper configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN container management is needed THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to start the container
2. WHEN container management is needed THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to stop the container
3. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL pass environment variables from the specified environment file
4. WHEN the container runs THEN the system SHALL properly configure the application based on the environment

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated build and deployment capabilities, so that I can efficiently manage application versions and container registry uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script runs THEN the system SHALL compile and package the application using Maven
2. WHEN the build script runs with ECR option THEN the system SHALL upload the container image to ECR
3. WHEN the image is tagged THEN the system SHALL use the version from pom.xml for the container tag
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of successful build and optional upload

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can ensure the application works correctly and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are implemented THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all business logic components
2. WHEN tests are implemented THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for AWS service interactions
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL validate the correctness of load testing functionality
4. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL validate configuration loading from SSM Parameter Store
5. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL validate DynamoDB operations and error handling
