# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables deployment of the DynamoDB Load Test application to AWS using ECS (Elastic Container Service) with complete infrastructure provisioning. The solution will provide on-demand task execution in a secure, scalable environment with proper networking, logging, and access controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ECS Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the load test application as an ECS task in a dedicated cluster, so that I can run load tests on-demand in AWS with proper resource isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL create an ECS cluster for the load test tasks
2. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL create an ECS task definition with appropriate resource allocation
3. WHEN running a load test THEN the system SHALL launch the task on-demand without requiring scheduled execution
4. WHEN the task completes THEN the system SHALL automatically stop the task to minimize costs

### Requirement 2: Networking Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the ECS tasks to run in a private subnet with controlled internet access, so that the application is secure while still able to access AWS services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated VPC for the load test environment
2. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create a private subnet for running ECS tasks
3. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create a NAT Gateway to enable outbound internet access from private subnet
4. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create appropriate route tables for the private subnet
5. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create security groups that allow necessary AWS service access

### Requirement 3: AWS Service Access

**User Story:** As a load test operator, I want the ECS task to have proper permissions to access DynamoDB, SSM parameters, and CloudWatch, so that the application can function correctly in AWS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ECS task runs THEN it SHALL have read/write access to the specified DynamoDB table
2. WHEN the ECS task runs THEN it SHALL have read access to SSM parameters for configuration
3. WHEN the ECS task runs THEN it SHALL have write access to CloudWatch Logs for application logging
4. WHEN the ECS task runs THEN it SHALL use IAM roles with least-privilege access principles

### Requirement 4: Container Registry Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to push Docker images to ECR and deploy them to ECS, so that I can use AWS-native container registry with proper versioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the build script SHALL support pushing images to ECR
2. WHEN building the application THEN the build script SHALL accept an AWS profile parameter for authentication
3. WHEN pushing to ECR THEN the system SHALL tag images appropriately for versioning
4. WHEN deploying THEN the ECS task definition SHALL reference the ECR image

### Requirement 5: CloudWatch Logging

**User Story:** As an operator, I want application logs to be sent to CloudWatch Logs, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot load test executions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ECS task runs THEN all application logs SHALL be sent to CloudWatch Logs
2. WHEN creating infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create dedicated log groups for the application
3. WHEN viewing logs THEN they SHALL be organized by task execution for easy filtering
4. WHEN logs are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate retention policies

### Requirement 6: Deployment Script Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment script to support AWS profiles, so that I can deploy to different AWS accounts securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running deployment scripts THEN they SHALL accept an AWS profile parameter
2. WHEN using AWS profiles THEN the scripts SHALL authenticate using the specified profile credentials
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the scripts SHALL provide clear error messages about authentication or permissions
4. WHEN deploying THEN the scripts SHALL validate AWS credentials before proceeding

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parameters template to include all AWS-specific configurations, so that I can easily manage environment-specific settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating parameters THEN the template SHALL include ECS-specific configuration options
2. WHEN updating parameters THEN the template SHALL include networking configuration options
3. WHEN updating parameters THEN the template SHALL include ECR repository configuration
4. WHEN updating parameters THEN the template SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing local configurations

### Requirement 8: Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a new team member, I want comprehensive documentation for the AWS deployment process, so that I can understand and use the deployment features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include step-by-step AWS deployment instructions
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include AWS profile configuration guidance
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include troubleshooting information for common deployment issues
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include examples of running on-demand load tests in AWS
